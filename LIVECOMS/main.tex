\begin{abstract}
This tutorial serves as a getting-started guide for BioSimSpace (BSS), an interoperable molecular dynamics framework, that allows simulations with different sets of molecular dynamics software packages. The tutorial will cover four main use cases for BioSimSpace. The introductory tutorial introduces the basic structure of BioSimSpace, how to use the API to access functionality, and how to write to use it for setting up and running standard molecular dynamics simulations. Furthermore, the tutorial provides three advanced use cases of BSS on how to set up and run a funnel molecular dynamics simulation, steered MD in combination with Markov State modeling, and alchemical free energy calculations. 
\end{abstract}

\end{frontmatter}


\section{Introduction}

Biosimpace~\cite{bss_paper}(\url{http://biosimspace.org}) is a software that allows the setup and running of different types of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for different software packages. The software provides a common API in Python  for MD software packages: AMBER~\cite{}, GROMACS~\cite{}, NAMD~\cite{} and has built-in analysis of simulation through MDAnalysis~\cite{}, MDTraj~\cite{}, alchemlyb~\cite{}...%TODO add more dependencies here. 

\section{Prerequisites and Scope}
%TODO expand this:
\subsection{Background knowledge}
To get the most out of this tutorial the reader should be familiar with Python and how to use Jupyter~\cite{} notebooks. For the introductory set of tutorials a background in molecular dynamics simulations is expected and if you are unfamiliar with this topic the best practices guide on foundations in biomolecular simulations is a good starting point~\cite{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6884151/}. Tutorial 2, on funnel metadynamics expects some background understanding of funnel metadynamics; a good starting point for studying this topic can be found in xxx~\cite{metadynamics citation}. Tutorial 3, expects knowledge on steered MD and Markov state modeling. If you are unfamiliar with these topics XXX et al. provide a good introduction to steered MD~\cite{sMD_steeredMD} and for more details on how to build MSM you can refer to the pyEMMA tutorial~\cite{https://livecomsjournal.org/index.php/livecoms/article/view/v1i1e5965/925} and a general introduction to the topic by Husic et al.~\cite{sMD_Husic-msm}.
The final and 4th tutorial covers how to use BSS to run alchemical free energy calculations. Mey et al.'s Best practices guide to alchemical free energy calculations provides a broad introduction and overview of this method~\cite{mey2020best}.

%\section{Checklists}
%Tutorials do not necessarily require the use of a checklist as in Best Practices documents; however, they can include these if desired.
%Several useful checklist formats are available, with examples presented in \texttt{sample-document.tex} in \url{github.com/livecomsjournal/article_templates/templates}.
%One example is shown here.
%
% Here is a single-column checklist that consists of multiple sub-checklists
