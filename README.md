# BioSimSpace tutorials

An introduction to BioSimSpace and advanced tutorials covering example use cases.
These tutorials are currently a work in progress. To use the _exact_ version of
BioSimSpace for which they were written, use:

```
conda install -c conda-forge -c omnia -c michellab/label/workshop biosimspace
```

(Please note that there have been several bug fixes since, including a fix
to the calculation of the funnel correction term used in tutorial 02.)

* 01 - [Introduction](01_introduction)
* 02 - [Funnel metadynamics](02_funnel_metad)
* 03 - [Steered molecular dynamics and ensemble building](03_steered_md)
* 04 - [Free-energy perturbation](04_fep)
